#   Devlog Day 1

Today (Friday 23th of september 2016) I started my project on SnowLang.
A short explanation about SnowLang is that it brings game development to a new standard (at least I hope so).
With SnowLang you have access to many libraries by default.
A few of the supported libraries for this version will be GLFW, OpenGL & Vulkan, OpenCL and OpenAL.
The goal of this project is to create a language that is mainly focusing on game development/engineering.
